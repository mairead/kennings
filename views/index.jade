			p Come and join Eight Legged Horse arts organisation as we illustrate the natural world of Walthamstow Marshes and learn how to write a Viking Kenning to accompany your creations. Upload your pictures and kennings to our interactive nature map using the hashtag #Eight17 on Instagram or Twitter and see if we can chart the wildlife of the marshes!

			p Kennings are riddle-like phrases used by Viking and Anglo-Saxon poets to refer to or describe something without naming it directly. For example, a crow becomes a ‘swan of blood’, a snake is described as a ‘valley-trout’. The technique is easy to learn and after a small demonstration children can easily create their own.

			h2 What if I can’t make the events?

			img.float-img-left(src="images/placeholder-owl.png")

			p If you can't make the events then we would love for you to still take part by exploring the marshes yourself and drawing or writing your own kennings. Don’t forget to let us see them using the hashtag Eight17.
